<small>I'm still working on the README... sorry...</small>

We're going to be learning how to write tests with React and
[react-testing-library](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library).
It's going to be fantastic.

## Pre-requisites:

You should be familiar with modern JavaScript and writing React applications.
Prior testing experience is not necessary.

## System Requirements:

You'll need git and node@>=8 installed.

## Setup:

Run these commands in your terminal to get yourself setup:

```
git clone https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library-course.git --branch workshop-2018-09
cd react-testing-library-course/
npm install
npm run setup
```

Please answer the prompt about your email. That should get you all setup.
If you have issues I can help you work through them while everyone else is
working on exercises.
